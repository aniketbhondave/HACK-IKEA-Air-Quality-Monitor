This project shows how I hacked the IKEA Air Quality Monitor to expose real-time PM2.5 readings and the fan status in Home Assistant, using an ESP8266 (D1 Mini).

By default, the IKEA monitor only shows colored LEDs (green/yellow/red). 

With this hack, you get exact AQI values and can create automations in your smart home like this.
